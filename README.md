<b>Operating System:</b> macOS

<b>CMake version:</b> 3.30.3

<b>Note:</b> I wrote my original code using VScode on my mac laptop. However, I have edited it using the computers in the lab room, therefore it runs perfectly on the computers' <b>VScode</b>, not the regular Visual Studio.

<u>Instructions to compile the program:</u>
1. Open the folder (453-skeleton-a3-completed) using VScode.
2. Select the 'Unspecified' kit (if needed).
3. Build the program using CMake (exit code should be 0).
4. Open a new terminal.
5. Enter the following: 
```bash
cd build
./453-skeleton
```
6. Toggle between the different [fractals and their depths] using the arrow keys.  CHANGE!!!!
